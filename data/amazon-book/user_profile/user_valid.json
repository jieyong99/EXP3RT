        "input": "[Like]\n- The historical research involved in this one added a wonderful sense of accuracy that this tale needed. The Alice network was real. Many of the women mentioned are based on real people and their real stories. This was an excellent retelling of their challenge, specifically Eve\u2019s chapters. This is 100% of the reason this book is recommended by so many people and passed around so frequently. It\u2019s an important part of history well researched and embedded.\n- High tension. Eve\u2019s chapters ran with an intense sense of urgency that kept my interest and kept the story moving. I felt myself pulled to continue reading just to find out what happened next. She was captivating and compelling right from the first scene she popped into.\n- The romance side storyline worked. I don\u2019t always say that and I definitely don\u2019t think it was entirely necessary (not every story needs a romance) but this one works. It\u2019s believable and it works for this story.\n\n[Dislike]\n- Charlie\u2019s chapters.\n---\n[Like]\n- The core group felt more like themselves in this book.\n- There was more focus on Cindy's job and her importance to the story/group.\n\n[Dislike]\n- A few grammatical errors and continuity errors.\n- The 20th book recycles things from the previous 19, making it feel less climactic and terrifying.\n- The redundancy of some plot points.\n---\n[Like]\n- Mythology is kept intact and woven together into one focal point, Circe.\n- Description of witchcraft and herbal work.\n- Big messages buried for the reader to decode.\n\n[Dislike]\n- CW: Sexual assault (not graphic).\n- Some parts of the story move slowly and feel drawn out.\n- Too many characters being thrust at the reader at once, especially if not familiar with the mythology and stories behind the characters.\n---\n[Like]\n- Jillian. She\u2019s relatable, adorable, and totally realistic. Middle grade readers will relate to her struggles and root for her.\n- Realistic goals. Jillian isn\u2019t looking to win the Nobel Prize in fifth grade. Her goals are realistic and relatable. Her struggles are real.\n- Friendship goals. I loved how this friend group formed naturally without struggle or force. I like how we started the book feeling isolated and developed into one of the group. It was comforting and beautiful.\n\n[Dislike]\n- I wanted a bit more of the other characters. Granted, this is Jillian\u2019s story (obviously) and we do get a little of the others. But if I said I wasn\u2019t wondering what home is like for Marquez and William, I\u2019d be lying! I\u2019m just saying, I see spin off potential here.\n---\n[Like]\n- The prologue is amazing and makes you want to read the rest.\n- The mystery is satisfying and keeps the reader guessing.\n- The portrayal of terrible people behaving badly adds to the addictive nature of the story.\n\n[Dislike]\n- There are a lot of out of touch rich people in the story, which may be off-putting.\n- The 3rd person omniscient POV causes head hopping and makes it hard to connect with the characters.\n- The big reveal felt sudden and popped up out of nowhere.\n---\n[Like]\n- High tension and high stakes done well\n- Well written airplane personnel\n- The ending works\n\n[Dislike]\n- The dream sequences were weird\n- Waffled between thinking the \u201cbad guys\u201d were making good points and being curious if they were too stereotypical\n---\n[Like]\n- Intriguing twists that keep the story interesting.\n- The recap from the events of Black Book were enough that I wasn\u2019t lost, even though it\u2019s been a long time since I read Black Book. Also, because of that recap, I think you\u2019d be fine reading this if you hadn\u2019t read the first one.\n- Good characters. I do like Harney and the decisions that he makes, generally. He\u2019s got terrible luck and he does come into contact with an absurd amount of bad cops, but he\u2019s intriguing.\n\n[Dislike]\n- Some of the chapters were cut in weird spots. Once it literally cut mid conversation. This is a habit of Patterson\u2019s lately so I\u2019m on the lookout for it when I pick up one of his books. You almost have to look at the next chapter to see if it\u2019s a continuation before putting in a bookmark.\n- The time jumps starting in Part 2 got a bit confusing. You\u2019re flashing back and forth\n---\n[Like]\n- The technology held up well despite being published in the late 90s.\n- The mystery is wonderful and immediately sucks the reader into the story.\n- The story had questions and twists that intrigued the reader and kept them interested.\n\n[Dislike]\n- Some of the twists in the story felt cliche and stretched too thin.\n- The reader didn't feel overly connected to any character.\n- The ending felt overly dramatic and bordering on cheesy.\n- There's some fatphobic content and cliches for the brilliant characters.\n---",
